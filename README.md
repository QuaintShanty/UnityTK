It contains several components almost every game project will need and can be used as a base-framework / toolbox for writing games.

# Components

DataBindings
-----
DataBindings provide a simple and very comfortable way to bind data to arbitrary objects (like UI).
They are employing a tree-like structure that lets you bind to specific field / properties of objects and / or invoke methods on objects inside your tree.

They are most commonly used in some MVVM-like structure.

Utility
-----
Provides utility for UnityEssentials itself and commonly used methods that are handy when working with unity.
