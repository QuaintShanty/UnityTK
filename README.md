# UnityTK

This is a library of scripts for Unity Engine Projects.
It contains several components almost every game project will need and can be used as a base-framework / toolbox for writing games.

# Components

DataBindings
-----

DataBindings provide a simple and very comfortable way to bind data to arbitrary objects (like UI).
They are employing a tree-like structure that lets you bind to specific field / properties of objects and / or invoke methods on objects inside your tree.

They are most commonly used in some MVVM-like structure.

AssetManagement
----

Asset bundle based asset management system that can be used to implement DLCs, Modding or just to seperate your assets into several asset bundles.
It provides an abstract and easy to use api to query for assets previously loaded and registered.

BuildSystem
----

Provides very simple interface and pre-built components to automate building unity projects.


Utility
-----
Provides utility for UnityTK itself and commonly used methods that are handy when working with unity.
