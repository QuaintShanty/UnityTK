Camera:

UTKCamera
----------------
Unity tk camera class
n amount of ICameraMode instances
n amount of ICameraInput

ICameraInput
----------------
Vector3 GetMovementAxis();
Vector2 GetLookAxis();
An input module to encapsulate an input method like mouse and keyboard, or screen panning, or whatever

Camera modes:

ICameraMode
----------------
n amount of ICameraModeInputProcessors as data source
Object composition master
Base implementation ACameraMode, abstract
Sets up constraints for components on the camera mode
Only one per gameobject, one gameobject with components = 1 mode
Referenced via the mode instance

ICameraModeInputProcessor
----------------
n amount of ICameraInput sources
Vector3 GetMovementDelta(); - Movement delta based on user input
Vector2 GetLookDelta(); - Look delta based on user input in screenspace, for mouse this equals (mousePos - lastMousePos)

ICameraModeController
----------------
Implements FPS, TPS, TopDown, whatever behaviour
Input data read from ICameraInput
Manipulates data on ICameraData according to input
A camera mode can have multiple (n) mode controllers

ICameraModeDataInterpolator<TDataFrom, TDataTo>
----------------
Singleton
Interpolates camera data from one to another type.

ICameraModeData
----------------
Contains data for a camera mode.
Example:
- Projection matrix
- Camera position
- Camera rotation
- ...

ICameraModeFeature
----------------
Interface for implementing a specific feature in a camera mode.
Used to create new interfaces which contain the actual interface to camera features.
Feature examples:
- Waypoint movement (IWaypointMovement : ICameraModeFeature)
- Camera shake (ICameraShake : ICameraModeFeature)
- Camera property interpolator (ICameraPropertyInterpolator : ICameraModeFeature)
- ...

Camera data:
- Position
- Rotation
- Projection
- FoV
- Ortho size
- ...

Camera:
- UTKCamera
- CameraMouseInput
- CameraKeyboardInput

FPSCameraMode:
- FPSCameraMode
- LookInputProcessor
-> Input processor ignoring movement only letting the player look around
- LookCameraModeController
Movement is not handled by camera but some other game code!

TPS Camera Mode:
- TPSCameraMode
- LookInputProcessor
- LookCameraModeController
Movement is not handled by camera but some other game code!

Top down camera mode:
- TopDownCameraMode
- MovementInputProcessor
-> Input processor ignoring rotation only letting the player move around
- PlaneMovementCameraController
-> Moves the camera on a specific world plane based on processed input

Iso camera mode:
- IsometricCameraMode
- MovementInputProcessor
- PlaneMovementCameraController
